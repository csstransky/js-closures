A config.js file will need to be included that follows this format:
const config = {
    apiKey : "API_KEY"
}

You can call a function as a constant variable, AND it must include a parenthesis or else it won't execute
what's inside of the function.

const report = updateClicks; // BAD, this will not print correctly
const report = updateClicks(); // GOOD, code in the function is now being executed

I think this has to do with the fact that you're saying that variables can be input into the function.
